        <h3><i>2015</i></h3>
        <p>I was invited to be a part of a team with a professor at the University of Ottawa to present during the IEEE International Humanitarian Conference in summer 2015.
          We presented to a panel of various officials from tech companies, IEEE executives, and the Canadian Forces on a humanitarian project that took place a few years prior.
          We also spoke about how IEEE can attract more youth to participate in such activities and projects. The presentation was well met and we were given an award.</p>
