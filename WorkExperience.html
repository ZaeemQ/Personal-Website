<h3>Shoppers Drug Mart</h3>
<p>During my short time at Shoppers Drug Mart, I learned a lot about what it means to be a team player. I worked with a group of amazing and unique individuals.
Though, the job itself was not very technical, it definitely helped me grow in to a more mature and well rounded individual. My respnsibilities included Customer Service,
manning the cash register, and organizing the store room and overstock. I had a fantastic time here, and I am sure I can use some skills that I acquired here in all aspects of my life.</p>

<h3>Private Tutor for Gr 7 Student</h3>
<p>During my time teaching a young 7th grade student various subjects (primarily math) I learned a lot about communication. The material itself was a piece of cake, but explaining it in a way that would enable
the student to understand me was a  different kind of challenge. It forcedm me to think as the student would think, be able to relate to him and explain the material in a way that he would find engaging and exciting.
I am glad to say, the student improved dramatically from before my tutelage</p>
