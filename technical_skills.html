        I have been self teaching myself web developement for a few months now. I know the basics of HTML, CSS and javascript. Along with these, I have taught myself how to work with bootstrap for quick and easy solutions to my webdev needs.

    <p>
        I am quite familiar with Java, I have been using it since approximately 2010. Most of my courses that have taught various aspects of computer science used Java as their language of choice. I took an extra course in C to learn moer about pointers and take a closer look at a lower level language.

          I have always been quite good with my words, and that has usually translated well to a written medium as well. This was further proven upon taking a professional communication course at University. I got very nearly a perfect score in the course, and glowing praise from my prof. He has agreed to be a source for me for my job seeking ventures.

          <p>From my few years as an Electrical Engineering student, I have garnered some skills in that field. I can read circuits, voltages, as well as some circuit design in Quartus software. Though Electrical Engineering is behind me, I have included these details for the chance that they might be relevant to anyone viewing this online resume.</p>
