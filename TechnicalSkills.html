<h3>Web Developement</h3>
<p>I have been self teaching myself web developement for a few months now. I know the basics of HTML, CSS and javascript.
Along with these, I have taught myself how to work with bootstrap for quick and easy solutions to my webdev needs.</p>

<h3>Java and C</h3>
<p>I am quite familiar with Java, I have been using it since approximately 2010. Most of my courses that have taught various aspects of
computer science used Java as their language of choice. I took an extra course in C to learn moer about pointers and take a closer look at a lower level language.</p>

<h3>Excellent Oral and Written Communication, and Technical Report Skills </h3>
<p>I have always been quite good with my words, and that has usually translated well to a written medium as well. This was further proven upon taking a professional communication
course at University. I got very nearly a perfect score in the course, and glowing praise from my prof. He has agreed to be a source for me for my job seeking ventures.</p>

<h3>Electrical Engineering Skills</h3>
<p>From my few years as an Electrical Engineering student, I have garnered some skills in that field. I can read circuits, voltages, as well as some circuit design in Quartus software.
Though Electrical Engineering is behind me, I have included these details for the chance that they might be relevant to anyone viewing this online resume.</p>
